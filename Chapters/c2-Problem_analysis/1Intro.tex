\chapter{Problem Analysis}\label{Chapter:Problem_analysis}
To precisely determine and delimit the problem, which this project aims to solve, the following chapter delves into multiple aspects related to robotic application in search and rescue operations, including mobile robotics and echolocation. This provides the foundation in which the project is built upon and should clearly provide limitations and explanations on the solution and to why it is relevant. To understand how robot can be applicable in search and rescue it is first and foremost necessary to understand the situations in which these operations occurs.
